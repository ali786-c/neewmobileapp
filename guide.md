---

## 📋 Verification Guidelines for Phase 1: Custom Match Rules

Use these guidelines to write tests or perform manual QA sessions when validating custom over structures, batsman run credits, junior cricket limits, and Last-Man-Standing scoring configurations.

### 1. 🏏 Custom Over Size Verification
*   **Objective**: Confirm that overs increment only when the configured number of legal balls has been bowled.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Create a tournament rule profile with `legal_balls_per_over` set to `7` or `8`.
    2.  Create a live match under this profile.
    3.  Bowl consecutive legal deliveries.
    4.  Verify that the `over_number` on the recorded deliveries remains `1` up to delivery 7 (for a 7-ball over), and the `ball_number` goes from `1` to `7`.
    5.  Record the next legal delivery and assert that it correctly starts over `2`, ball `1`.
*   **Expected Result**: Overs transition dynamically based on the rule profile's legal ball limit.

### 2. ➕ Batsman Runs Credits for Extras
*   **Objective**: Verify that batsman personal scores are credited with wide/no-ball extra runs when specific rule flags are active.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Enable both `wide_runs_to_batsman` and `noball_runs_to_batsman` flags in the tournament rule profile.
    2.  Log a Wide ball (1 wide run) and verify that the striker's batting stats runs increment by `1`.
    3.  Log a No-Ball (1 no-ball run + 2 runs off the bat) and verify that the striker's runs increment by `3` (previous 1 + 1 penalty + 2 runs).
*   **Expected Result**: Striker's personal score increases directly by the wide/no-ball runs, instead of these runs counting solely as team extras.

### 3. 🚫 Junior Cricket Capping Limits
*   **Objective**: Assert that overs are capped when the maximum allowed deliveries (legal + illegal) or runs are reached.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Set `max_balls_per_over` to `8` and `max_runs_per_over` to `10` in the rule profile.
    2.  Bowl 8 Wide balls consecutively.
    3.  Attempt to record a 9th delivery in that same over.
    4.  Verify that the system throws a validation error indicating the over limit has been reached, forcing the over to close.
*   **Expected Result**: Scorer is prevented from adding more deliveries than the defined over caps.

### 4. 👥 Last Man Standing (LMS) Rules
*   **Objective**: Confirm that the innings continues after the 9th wicket falls when LMS is enabled.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Create a team with a `playing_xi_size` of `2` and rule profile `maximum_wickets` of `2`. Enable `last_man_standing`.
    2.  Log the first wicket. Verify that the match status remains `live` (in standard rules, the match would be marked completed at 1 wicket down out of 2 players).
    3.  Log the second wicket (striking out the last man). Verify that the match and innings status transition to `completed` and the result is marked `all_out`.
*   **Expected Result**: Innings only completes when all players (including the last man standing) are out.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Live Scoring & Offline Sync Support Verification

Use these guidelines to test the `/api/v1/matches/{match}/deliveries/sync` batch sync API.

### 1. 📶 Offline Batch Scoring Sync Verification
*   **Objective**: Confirm that the backend can sync a batch of deliveries recorded offline, processing them chronologically.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Construct a JSON payload containing an array of 3 deliveries, each with a unique `local_uuid` and sequential `device_timestamp` timestamps.
    2.  Submit the payload to `POST /api/v1/matches/{match}/deliveries/sync` using an authenticated Sanctum token.
    3.  Assert the response returns status `200` with each delivery marked as `"status": "synced"`.
    4.  Verify the database records contain the 3 deliveries with their respective `local_uuid` and `device_timestamp` values correctly stored.
*   **Expected Result**: All 3 deliveries are processed chronologically and successfully written to the database.

### 2. 🔂 Sync Idempotency (Duplicate Prevention)
*   **Objective**: Assert that if a sync request is retried (e.g. due to connection timeouts), duplicate deliveries are ignored.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Submit the exact same batch of 3 deliveries (using the same `local_uuid` values) to the sync endpoint again.
    2.  Assert that the response returns status `200`, but each delivery is now returned with `"status": "already_sync"`.
    3.  Verify the database still contains exactly 3 deliveries for this match (no new deliveries were created).
*   **Expected Result**: Backend recognizes existing `local_uuid` records, skipping duplicates and returning success indicators to the client.

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Tournament Draft Room & Live Draft Settings Verification

Use these guidelines to test the tournament `has_draft` setting and route protection middleware.

### 1. 🎛️ has_draft Storage Verification
*   **Objective**: Verify that the `has_draft` boolean is correctly saved during tournament creation and update.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Send a `POST /api/v1/admin/tournaments` request with payload `'has_draft' => true`.
    2.  Verify the returned tournament object has `has_draft: true` and is persisted in the database.
    3.  Send a `PUT /api/v1/admin/tournaments/{tournament}` request with payload `'has_draft' => false`.
    4.  Verify that `has_draft` is updated to `false` in the database.
*   **Expected Result**: `has_draft` setting is stored and updated correctly.

### 2. 🛡️ Draft Room Route Protection
*   **Objective**: Confirm that accessing draft screens or endpoints for a tournament without a draft throws a 403 Forbidden error.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Identify/create a tournament where `has_draft` is `false`.
    2.  Attempt to request `GET /api/v1/tournaments/{tournament}/draft/state`.
    3.  Assert the response returns status `403 Forbidden` with the message `"Drafting is not enabled for this tournament."`.
    4.  Verify the same 403 response on web routes like `/admin/tournaments/{tournament}/draft/setup`.
*   **Expected Result**: Access is blocked and returns a clear 403 response, preventing any drafting operations.

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Live Broadcast Sync Channels Verification

Use these guidelines to verify real-time event broadcasting over Pusher.

### 1. 📢 Scoring Event Broadcast Verification
*   **Objective**: Verify that `DeliveryRecorded` is fired with the correct metrics payload whenever a delivery is scored.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Subscribe a test WebSocket client to the channel `matches.{match_id}`.
    2.  Record a new delivery via the scoring endpoint.
    3.  Verify the client receives a broadcast event named `delivery.recorded`.
    4.  Assert that the event payload contains:
        *   `delivery` parameters (runs, extras, notation, etc.).
        *   `match` totals (overall runs, wickets, legal balls, and new revision number).
*   **Expected Result**: Real-time broadcast fires with complete delivery/match statistics.

### 2. ↩️ Undo Event Broadcast Verification
*   **Objective**: Confirm that `DeliveryUndone` is fired when the scorer voids the last delivery.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Ensure the WebSocket client is subscribed to `matches.{match_id}`.
    2.  Submit an undo request to the match undo endpoint.
    3.  Verify the client receives a broadcast event named `delivery.undone`.
    4.  Assert that the event payload contains the updated match scorecard totals after rollback.
*   **Expected Result**: Real-time undo broadcast fires with updated match scores.

## 🛠️ Phase 5: Wagon Wheel Coordinate System Verification

Use these guidelines to verify spatial vector coordinate tracking for match deliveries.

### 1. 📍 Coordinate Storage & Payload Verification
*   **Objective**: Verify that `wagon_x` and `wagon_y` coordinates are correctly saved in the database and validated between `0` and `100`.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Submit a score delivery request with `'wagon_x' => 45.5` and `'wagon_y' => 78.2`.
    2.  Verify the HTTP status is `200` and the database contains the recorded coordinates.
    3.  Submit a score delivery request with `'wagon_x' => 105.0` (out of bounds).
    4.  Verify that validation fails with a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status.
*   **Expected Result**: Valid coordinates are saved successfully, and out-of-bounds inputs are blocked.

### 2. 📡 Real-Time Coordinate Broadcasting
*   **Objective**: Ensure the `DeliveryRecorded` event includes the spatial coordinates in its payload.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Subscribe a test WebSocket client to `matches.{match_id}`.
    2.  Submit a valid score delivery with coordinates.
    3.  Verify that the broadcast event payload contains the matching `wagon_x` and `wagon_y` attributes under the `delivery` details.
*   **Expected Result**: Coordinates are broadcasted in real-time to the listeners.

### 1. 🏆 MVP Points Calculations & Leaderboard Sorting
*   **Objective**: Confirm that player batting, bowling, and fielding points are calculated correctly and sorted by total points.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Create a match and score multiple deliveries involving batters scoring runs (with boundary/six/run milestones), bowlers taking wickets and bowling maidens (with extras deductions), and fielders making catches/run-outs.
    2.  Submit a `GET /api/v1/matches/{match}/mvp` request with an authorized token.
    3.  Verify the HTTP status is `200` and the response payload contains player statistics along with their calculated points break-downs.
    4.  Assert that:
        *   Batting points reflect runs + boundary credits + milestone bonuses.
        *   Bowling points reflect wickets + maidens - extras.
        *   Fielding points reflect catches, stumpings, and run-outs.
        *   The array of players is sorted by total points in descending order.
*   **Expected Result**: Performance metrics maps to the correct point weightings, and the leaderboard is sorted by total points.

## 🛠️ Phase 7: Player Comparison API Verification

Use these guidelines to verify the player comparison service and endpoint.

### 1. 📊 Side-by-Side Statistics Verification
*   **Objective**: Verify the compared player stats return accurate tournament aggregates and ratios.
*   **Test Steps**:
    1.  Identify two approved players in a tournament who have matches played and deliveries scored.
    2.  Perform a `GET /api/v1/tournaments/{tournament}/players/compare` query passing `player1_id` and `player2_id` parameters.
    3.  Assert the response returns status `200` with both players compared side-by-side.
    4.  Verify that:
        *   Batting averages match total runs divided by total dismissals.
        *   Strike rates match runs divided by balls faced multiplied by 100.
        *   Bowling averages, economies, and strike rates correspond precisely to the cumulative tournament deliveries.
*   **Expected Result**: Comparison API successfully aggregates and displays side-by-side profiles of the two players.
